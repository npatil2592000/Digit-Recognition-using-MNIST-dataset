# Digit-Recognition-using-MNIST-dataset
This is my first deep learning project.Here I have used a MNIST handwritten dataset downloaded from kaggle.
I have build a Convolution Neural Network for digit recognition trained on MNIST dataset using Keras API.
I have achieved test accuracy of 99.25%.
I have used a self made custom cnn network in this project.
